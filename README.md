# Entering the project you can see a list of users without seeing their password and the ability to log in

# By logging into the admin account, you can collect user data in xml and ssv files

# You can also create new users and see all the data about existing ones.

# Also, being an administrator, you can upload a data file from which new models will be created

# It is also possible to upload a file in the admin panel via django import
